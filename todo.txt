- Consider that we have to explicitly save sessions stuff and first loaded tiles via a specific API call.
- Tile color got from API can be null.
- Reload all tiles that were associated with fetched booking on fetching tiles.
- Fetching whole bookings instead of tiles. Should be flattened in front-end.
- Split saving colors and room assignments. Colors should be associated with bookings.
- Add from dates to booking and booking short by id fetch.
- Add booking id to clients by tile request.
- Add date interval to clients by query request. Load asynchronously clients spliting the whole period from 01/01/2021 to nowdays into more smaller periods for more responsiveness.
- Handle html entities in back-end response.
- Handle live modified tiles.
- Use POST for police data export. Don't download it, just wait for ok status.
- Add download police ricevuta button.
- Remove entity property from tile data.
- Handle touchscreen.
